            <p>
                i use DG441 to make thing that if u press button change waveform and press another button 
                change frequency.
                
                <br>
                technically there should be a triangle wave setting but idfk, i didnt solder the ground properly or
                something, who the fuck knows.

                Enjoy my shrekscope screenshots (thank you screk)

                Cringe cirkuit. As with all mixed signal cirkuits the digital works fine, the analogue is 
                coupled to a bunch of god knows fucking what and refuse to work 40% of the time. I was going 
                to make this into a PCB as an Altium exercise but I don't know lol. This is too cringe to even PCB.
                The button voltages are still pulled down to 2V because the digital part is ripped entirely from my 
                ELEC3106 project, where my stupidFloppaBrain decided to do an optimised state machine with 3 states from 
                2 flip flops even though i could've jsut done 4. The wave gen is handled entirely by this chip called 
                XR2206CP which is a single supply monolithic function generator (obtained from uh, temu) but WHO CARES OKAY
                WE ALL DIE ANYWAY.
