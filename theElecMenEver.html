               TheElecMenEver are just guys in elec who know what theyre doing AND are respectful and also believe that I too can be a good electrical engineer. People who tell you that "You can do this" instead of 
               "Hmm Elec is quite a bit harder than civil engineering huh". People that don't make you feel stupid for not knowing something you didn't know. You know, people who 
               respect you and your gaps in knowledge, and acknowledge that you're a peer, not a diversity muppet. People who make you feel like 
               you belong in electrical engineering.
