            Started my first year at UNSW in 2022, which was honestly pretty optimal given that
            C0BiD fucked up the last year of high school (which was barely important anyway).
            Made it just in time for in person uni!!! Great! What could go wrong? (Hint: Depression).

            I made this whole thing in procreate using Lasso or whatever its called to cut and paste. 
            Surprising a lot of colour correction was involved and tracing over like 2 pixels to make sure
            things blend into the background. Yea well im no Photoshop god. In fact I don't even have Photoshop.
