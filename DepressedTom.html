        <p>
            I made this whole thing in procreate using Lasso or whatever its called to cut and paste. 
            Surprising a lot of colour correction was involved and tracing over like 2 pixels to make sure
            things blend into the background. Yea well im no Photoshop god. In fact I don't even have Photoshop.
            Please sponsor me.
