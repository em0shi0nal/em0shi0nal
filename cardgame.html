            I draw my friends. Honestly these sketches are decent and I was pretty proud of them.

            Yea well this isnt gonna make sense to people not in the friend group, but back in the 
            day of ELEC2133 my friend made little flashcards that are shaped like playing cards. 
            So I had a headcanon of making electrical engineering themed card games! Never really 
            worked out the rules of this game but imagine if you could assemble circuits with component
            cards and try to get a higher voltage or current than the other player? Wouldn't that be pretty
            cool (to maybe a total of 2 people on this planet) (no one is playing this game brah)
         </p>
         <p>
            These designs eventually led to the <a href = "/Projects.html"> website extension </a>
            that I made. 

            <br>
            Everyone that I've shown seem to think the art is cooler than the code and stuff which, I mean I'll take it.
            But I was really hoping to get a small coding project under my belt QAQ (I taught myself javascript for this!)

            <br>
            <br>
            COULD AI DO THIS??? Probably.
