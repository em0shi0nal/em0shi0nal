                he needs to start reading textbook instead of watching girls shake ass on instagram reels. Begone thots! Anyway. Here I will dump miscellaneous elec brain cells
                gained from worshipping SedraBible as well as anything I learn from projects outside of school. I WILL be one of theElecMenEver!!! I do not care if i never have a gf
