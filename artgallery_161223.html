            How to deal with feeling like a shit engineer
        </h1>
        <p>
          I don't know about you, but every other day I feel like I am YEARS behind my peers. 
          Even this website makes me a bit emo
         sometimes because man, someone was probably doing this stuff back in highschool. What was I doing back
         in highschool? Probably eating cheetos and licking cheeto dust off my fingers.

            I feel much less self aware when I'm working through these feelings of imposter syndrome on my own
            than when I'm consoling someone else. And yeah, it FEELS difficult. I guess the more you achieve, the more 
            you WANT to achieve, naturally leading to higher expectations. The more you climb the more you realise 
            there is yet to climb.
        </p>

        <p>
            So yeah I guess the answer is: I don't know.

             Maybe it's just something to do with maturity. I'm turning 21
            this year and these are very early 20s dilemma that people have. Maybe it'll get better with age? Like when 
            i'm 24 maybe I just wont give a shit anymore. I go to work and I come home, I try not to get laid off by
            corporate. YAY! Lovely. I am so excited.
