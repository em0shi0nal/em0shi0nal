            This guy was an engineering manager in the US for 10 years. Really chill dude. Talked about
            production lines and team work something something. 
            IM SORRY (it was a 9am lecture), I retained maybe 10% of it also cus I was drawing lol. 
            I think he manages stuff I mean its in the job title. He kept on saying acronyms every few seconds
            because I guess the nature of his job required lots of things to be abbreviated.
            Hence "Engineers-Love-Acrynoms", his words not mine. I just thought it was kinda funny cus 
            yeah!!! Engineers!!! Makes sense. TIWWD (This Is What We Do).
