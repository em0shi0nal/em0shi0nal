        <p>
            Not really sure what was happening here, but i think i probably wanted 
            to go for the vibe of an AMV or something. Alas, animation is not an ideal
            career for a lazy person such as myself, so we ended up with this composition
            that resembles some kind of photoshoot at the garbage dump surrounded by evil 
            bunnies.
