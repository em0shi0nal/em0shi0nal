            You know that meme that goes something like 
            <img src= "./projects/ciognitive restructuring.png" title ="damn" 
                alt = "" height = "100px" width = "300px"
                style = "display: block;
                margin-left: auto;
                margin-right: auto;
                max-width: 100%; 
                height: auto; "/>
        </p>
        
        That is kind of like me. Except my maladaptive pattern is more like "I HIT A CURB" "ITS CUS IM FEMALE" 
        <br>
        ->Depression.
        <br>

        So my cognitive restructuring helps me do something like "I HIT A CURB" "Floppa is a male caracal cat and cats are bad at driving" 
        <br>
        -> No Depression

        <br>

        This really helps for when some more serious trauma happen in my life. Someone brought up an interesting point
        being like you should just uh, respect yourself. Idk I think that requires actual therapy meanwhile pretending to
        be a male caracal cat is free and works perfectly fine. I think I just fr need time to heal and believe that my life 
        will keep getting better instead of going to shit. BUT I CANT KEEP TAKING THESE LS MAN!!!!!
