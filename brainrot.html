              WARNING: the way I *coded* these dropdowns was insanely cringe so theres a bit of 
              propagation delay. Just try pressing again it dropdown doesnt work the first time.

                    Probably one of my favourite course so far. Out of all the courses I've done up until this point
                    ELEC3106 was probably the one course that actually forced me to grow some braincells. You've got to write a 
                    lab report in pairs every fortnight for like, 2.25% as well as a final design report worth 15%.

                    Lab1 you start by revising op amp characteristics from ELEC2133, then LAB2 
                    gets into the non-idealities of logic gates. Lab3 was EMI and Lab4 on SPICE simulations. I reckon the difficulty of
                    this course peaks at around Lab2, at which point you sorta get used to the expectations of this course. The difficulty
                    tapers off from that point, I assume to give you some space and room to work on the project. 

                    <br><br>
                    The lab project from our year was an electrically configurable amplifier, which sounds a lot cooler than what it actually was because most 
                    of the cohort ended up using like the same three ICs. I definitely was crying and shitting myself when I started the project 
                    in week 6 though, because I've quite literally never designed anything myself before and up until week 4 I thought a level shifting bjt was an amplifier. 
                    So uh, yeah. It was challenging and definitely worthwhile starting the project early and attempting a range of solutions, even if the initial solutions are shit.

                    Finishing ELEC3106 and actually studying properly you'll come out the other end feeling as if you'd just developed a prefrontal cortex. 
                    Torsten was also just great and such a respectful person. He is genuinely patient with his students and you
                    feel at ease asking him questions, which I unfortunately cannot say for uhm, all lecturers. Torsten is actually like THE  <a href = "theElecMenEver.html" style = "color: white"> theElecMenEver</a>
                    and I am very excited for ELEC4602.
